# To-Do List
Developing a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fun and interactive way to learn web development and practice programming.
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a simple hand game played between two players, where each player simultaneously chooses one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. 
## The winner is determined based on the rules:

- Rock beats Scissors.
- Scissors beat Paper.
- Paper beats Rock.

This project involves creating a web-based version of the game where the player competes against the computer.
